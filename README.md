# InteractiveCoffeeSalesDashboard
Sales-of-the-Coffee Interactive Dashboard. Click around. Use the filters. Manipulate the visuals as you please!

I've created a simple interactive dashboard of a company's coffee sales. On this dashboard, you will see and can interacte with:
  - one line chart with the total sales of coffee over time split by the four coffee types the company provides
  - one bar chart displaying the total amount of sales by the countries the coffee is puchased
  - one bar chart of the top 5 customers
  - three slicers allowing quick and easy filtering

I bagan by combining the three worksheets of information into one by use of XLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH. After getting all the needed information on one worksheet, I then calculated the sales amount by using a multiplication formula, of course. From here, I then focused on cleaning up the data a bit by creating multiple IF functions, changing the date amd number formats, and deleting any and all duplicates.

Now that the data had been prepped and cleaned, I then converted that data into a table. From that table, I created pivot tables and charts, a timeline, and a few slices that can all be mannipulated. 

Enjoy!
